Springer EVA 2021 spatiotemporal wildfire prediction data challenge:
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10687-023-00465-x
Wildfires are from 3 things: presence of combustible material, easy flammibility due to weather conditions, and a trigger 
usually seasonal cycle
focuses on wildfire occurance and wildfire size

### notes
could do wildfire risk based on environmental/weather/time conditions
evacuation decisions
ignition sources vs ignition control, with recommendations? see "Modeling and mapping wildfire ignition risk in Portugal", could possibly apply to US 
analysis of danger levels by location
